#Cookies, Presents, and Deterministic Finite State Automata

##Hello, world!
Seeing as this is my first blog post, I suppose I have some explaining to do. So, hello there! My name is Brian Dennis, and you can find out about me [here](http://briandennis.io/about). But long story short, I'm a CS student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I'm interested in web development and theoretical computer science, specifically computational complexity theory. I also love the outdoors and taking pictures of it, which can be found [here](http://briandennis.io/photos). 

So what is the purpose of this blog? That is something I haven't quite figured out yet! To be completely honest, I didn't even start this with the intention of developing it. I was curious about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and thought messing around with a template layout would be a fun way to learn. Turns out Github Pages with Jekyll has a pretty low barrier to entry and I was up and running in under an hour. And since it was already setup and I had some extra time on my hands, I thought why not try to actually use the new site for something. 

As unorganized a plan for a blog that is, I do have a few ideas of what I'd like to accomplish with this. Mainly, I want it to be a place to write about what I'm learning at the moment, things I'm interested in, and my thoughts on what's going on in the world of tech. As I'm in college, I cannot guarantee how often I will post, but seeing as this is primarily for me to get my thoughts down and I don't plan on anyone reading this anyhow, that shouldn't be a problem!

##Self Study by the Fireplace 

So what have I been up to recently? I'm hoping to get involved in some research next semester, and to prepare for that I'm reading *[Introduction to the Theory of Computation](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451375563&sr=8-1&keywords=theory+of+computation)* by Michael Sipser. One my professors recommended this book for self study over break as preparation, so I decided to pick it up. Despite its unreasonable cost, especially considering its length, I am enjoying it quite a bit. So far most of the material has been review since I'm coming right out of a discrete math course, but I'm excited for what is to come.

The book is mainly an overview of three subjects in theoretical computer science. 

 - Automata and Languages
 - Computability Theory
 - Complexity Theory

Naturally, I'm interested in getting to the third section, but that requires working through the first 250 pages. That is why this holiday, I have spent a lot of time in coffee shops, and in a chair by the fire reading for hours on end. Whenever I'm not with my family or friends, there's a good chance I'm either programming or somewhere with that book open. Currently, I am still on finite state machines and regular expressions, but I hope to be much further along by New Year.
